My research focuses on developing novel visualization techniques for complex data analysis. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data visualization, human-computer interaction, and machine learning.

## Current Projects

### Visual Analytics for Large-Scale Data

This project develops new visualization methods to help users explore and analyze massive datasets. We focus on dimensionality reduction techniques combined with interactive visualizations.

### Interactive Machine Learning

We are exploring how visualization can help users better understand and interact with machine learning models, making AI more transparent and accessible.

### Scientific Visualization

Working with domain scientists to create tailored visualization tools for specific scientific domains, especially in computational biology and chemistry.

## Research Group
